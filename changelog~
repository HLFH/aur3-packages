1.3.0  November 13, 2012

- Make name in feature publish optional.
  Instead of always having to add the branch when doing a git flow feature
  publish, the name should be optional.
  When a name isn’t given, the current branch, if it’s a feature branch,
  will be published.
  
- Add option to select configuration file usage
  As with the regular git config, git flow init now has the
  option –file, –global, –system and –local. –local is default.

- Add a new command.
  New command git flow config is added.
  With this command you can see your current git flow configuration and you
  can also set the options.

- Environment settings for git-flow only.
  With git you can set environment variables to change behavior, like
  GIT_MERGE_AUTOEDIT for example.
  You can add these exports to the file ~/.gitflow_export if you only want
  to set the environment variable for git-flow.

- Bugfix: Missing command hotfix track.
  The command git flow hotfix track is not implemented.


1.2.0 October 11, 2012

Peter van der Does

- Improve the help output of the commands.

- Fix problem with init function on BSD systems.

- Add initialize function to git flow version.

- Add parameter –showcommands to all commands.
  This will show the git commands performed while executing the command. Thanks to Jerome Baum 
  for the original implementation.

- Display where user is on finish.
  Some commands did not display the branch you are on after the command finished.

- When finishing a hotfix/release and it’s to be tagged, the tag must not exist.


1.1.0 July 27, 2012

Peter van der Does

- Bugfix: feature finish does double merge when using squash option.

- Add the ability to keep/delete local/remote branches on finish.
  When finishing a release/hotfix/feature you now can keep/delete the
  local/remote release/hotfix/feature branch.

- New command: git flow release branch
  With this command you can directly release a given branch. There is no need
  to start a new release and finish it. You can not use this command on the
  git-flow branches feature/hotfix/release/support.

- Do not display object fetch summary if flag was not set.
  Thanks to Daniel Dehennin.

- Bugfix: Checking if branch exists will fail for remote branches.

- Make die output consistent for each die case.

- Bugfix: When running git flow init an error message pops up.

- Show correct help for subactions.
  When requesting help with -h for the subactions, the help would show the
  incorrect command line.

- Support reading the tag message from a file in release/hotfix finish.
  Add the option -f,–messagefile to release and hotfix finish. Thanks to
  Steve Streeting for the original coding.

- Bugfix: git_current_branch fails for git prior 1.7.10.
  git symbolic-ref does not have the –short option prior to version 1.7.10.
  Bug found by Daniel Dehennin.

- Clean up code.
  Remove all porcelain commands.
  Refactor code.

- Improve the back-merge functionality.
  Adds an command line option (-b), which the user can utilize if the user
  doesn’t want to back-merge but rather merge the release branch into
  develop.

- Add the sub-action delete to sub-commands feature, release and hotfix.
  The sub-commands feature, release and hotfix now have a new sub-action,
  delete. With that action you can delete the branches, locally and remote.
  The action has two options, -f and -r. With -f you can force the deletion,
  even when the to be deleted branch was not merged yet. With -r the remote
  branch will also be deleted.

Daniel Dehennin

- Bugfix: release/feature/hotfix start -F fails.
  Usage of positional parameters requires to eval ${FLAGS_ARGV}. The “eval set”
  in function call does not propagate to the caller.

- Accept tags as base for hotfix/release/support start.
  Commit pointed by tags are reachable with ^0[1].

- Check for parameter existence for branch and tag existence helpers.

- Do not finish hotfixes if they have no commits.
  A hotfix branch must have some commits and be ahead of master.

- Bugfix: When running git flow version an error message pops up.

- Reorder fetch and sanity checks.
  When a user requests a fetch for git flow {feature|hotfix|support} start, do
  this before some sanity checks to avoid any conflict in branch names
  and/or version.

- Fix flag test in cmd_delete().

Myke Hines

- Feature and Release squashing options.
  This allows a -S option to both feature and releasing finishing actions so
  that developers can squash commits into one large one.
  
Peter Ragone

- Add init to git-flow-{feature,release,hotfix,support}.
  Fixes the relatively minor issue where ‘git flow subcommand help’
  gives “Not a gitflow-enabled repo yet”.
